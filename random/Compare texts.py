a = """Are you tired of this? That? And those? Then I've got the solution for you. Introducing Windows Ghost Spectre! It's an optimized, lightweight, and fully controllable version of Windows that will boost your PC to its limits!

So, if you're interested, let's begin downloading this monster! The first link in the comments is a video from Ghost Spectre's YouTube channel, showcasing its performance. You'll find the download link in the video description. Don't close the tab yet because there are also passwords for the archive. Simply follow the video instructions to download the required files.

While you're waiting for the file to download, let me ask you a question. Do you want to achieve success for free? If your answer is "No, please don't make me successful," I won't push it further. However, if you're someone who embraces challenges, you'll love the content I'll be sharing here. It won't be easy and will require hard work, but the results will be worth it.

So, let's embark on this journey together, and I'll share my knowledge with you absolutely for free on this channel.

After you've finished downloading, extract the Windows image into any folder of your choice using the provided passwords. Then, you can choose one of two ways to set up the new Windows on your computer. The first method is the classic USB method, which requires a 4GB USB drive. The second method involves setting up a new disk volume and making it bootable with EasyBCD.

For the USB method, you'll need Rufus. You can find the downloading link in the comments. Open the software, select your USB drive, choose "Disk or ISO image," and navigate to the extracted file. Start the process and then proceed to the next section of the video, where I'll explain how to back up important files.

With this method, you can ditch the USB (no, seriously, don't throw it in the trash). You'll need 5GB of free space on your disk. First, download EasyBCD (link provided in the comments). Right-click the Windows icon, open disk management, shrink the desired volume, create a new volume from the free space, and click "Next" repeatedly. Once done, navigate to the extracted ISO file, open it as an archive, and copy all the files to the new volume. Then, open the EasyBCD program, add a new entry with WinPE by selecting the boot.wim file from the sources folder within the new volume. Don't forget to click the green plus icon. You should now see the new entry in the program.

Setting up the new Windows depends on your chosen method. If using the USB, restart your computer and enter the BIOS by pressing one of the specified buttons (shown in the video). In the BIOS, go to the boot menu and select your USB as the first boot option. Save the settings. If you chose the EasyBCD method, after the restart, you should see the dual boot menu. Select the new option.

Regardless of the method, you'll end up on the installation screen. This is the easiest part. Click the icon to start the standard installation. Now comes the important decision. For regular users or office purposes, choose the Compact version. However, for the ultimate experience, we'll select the Superlite version. The "DEF" refers to Windows Defender, so if you don't trust yourself, you shouldn't trust this either. The "SE" option includes StartIsBack for those who loved Windows 7. I'll opt for the Superlite version without Defender, but feel free to choose what suits you best.

IMPORTANT: This is a critical step. Choosing the wrong partition could lead to the destruction of your backup files. If you used the USB method, be extra cautious, as formatting the installation drive is possible. You can manage partitions here if needed, but for now, continue with the installation.

Once the installation is complete, you'll see a window with update options. Select the latest update option, and your computer will restart. Now, let's move on to the most crucial part of optimization: Ghost Toolbox. Don't be intimidated by the command-line interface; it won't bite. Let's disable unnecessary features that nobody uses. Action Centre and Notifications are windows that store useless notifications, affecting computer performance. Cortana? Who needs Cortana? If you use printers, you can enable that function. Otherwise, turn it off. Return to the menu. In the fourth tweak, you can activate Windows and turn off updates until the year 2077. You'll need the Microsoft Store in the future. Install Visual C++ and DirectX, and turn off Bingbar. Additionally, install Google Chrome since Internet Explorer is the only browser available. 7-Zip is also useful, so install it too.

Tweak number 39 is for gaming enhancements. Select "Old tweaked Windows 10" and disable the startup delay. The next option may increase the chances of hackers accessing your computer if used as a server, so turn it off. However, it can significantly boost your FPS if you're not using your PC as a server. Then, enable the ultimate performance plan if you're using a PC. Congratulations! You've completed the most tedious part of the configuration!

The next step is crucial for optimizing your graphics. Download "nvclearstall" (link provided in the comments). Choose the first option and click the "Recommend" button. You can also check other options like ShadowPlay if you wish. Simply follow my instructions.

After that, go to the Nvidia Control Panel and configure it as I demonstrate in the video."""

So you're interested... Then let's begin downloading this monster! The first link in the comments is video from Ghost Spectre's youtube channel. It's an showcase of perfomance. You'll find downloading link in the description of this video. Don't close the tab yet, because there's also passwords for the archive. Just follow the video and download the file you need...
While you're waiting for file to download - I will ask you a question. Do you want to be successfull for free? If your answer is "No, please don't make me successful"  - I won't push it further. However if you're not that type of people, who shy away from a challenge, you'd love the content I will post here. It's not going to be easy and will require hard work, but you'll defenetly enjoy the result.

So let's begin our journey together..
and I will share my knowledge with you absolutely for free, on this channel.

After you've done downloading, extract the windows image into any folder you want, using those passowrds.
Then, you can choose one of two ways of setting up new windows on your computer. One is the USB method, which is classic one. You'll need free 4gb USB for that. The second method is about setting up new disk volume and making it bootable with EasyBCD.


For this method you'll need Rufus (whispering) downloading link in the comments... Simply open this software and choose your USB drive. After that select "Disk or ISO image" and navigate to the file you just extracted. Leave everything else there and press start. When you're done with Rufus, go to the next section of this video, where I will tell you how to backup important files


With this method you can throw your USB into trash! (no, seriously, don't do that). You'll need 5GB of free space on your disk. You, ofcourse, can try with less space, but I don't recommend to do that. First step is to download EasyBCD. Follow the third link in the comments and you'll see this page...
Second step is to right click windows icon and open disk management. Then you'll have to shrink volume you want. Then right click the free space you just made and make new volume. Spam "Next" button.
After you're done - navigate to extracted ISO file and open it as archive. Copy all files to new volume... and open EasyBCD program. Add new entry with WinPE, by going into new new volume, opening sources folder and selecting boot.wim file. Don't forget to hit green plus icon. After you've done that - you should see new entry here. 


It's actually much easier than you think. if you want to backup big amount of data - you'll have to create new volume, which won't be affected by installation. If you have drives besides C: one, you can use them. If not, we will create them now. Right click windows icon and open disk management. From there - shrink your volume... and make new one out of that space. Then transfer any important data there (Show silly cortana picture, which i will backup)...


Restart your computer and if you use USB, hold one of those buttons (show buttons to open bios). After that you should see your BIOS. Go to the boot menu and choose your USB as first boot option and save settings.
If you were using EasyBCD, after restart you should see this menu. This is dual boot. Select new option.

It doesn't matter which method you chose, you will end up with this screen. It's actually the easiest part. Click this icon and follow standart installation.
Here comes the JUICE. Compact is for regular users or office fellows, we're not interested in that... However the SUPERLITE version is the ultimative thing. We defenetly choose this one. The DEF stands for windows defender, so if you don't trust yourself, you should not trust this thing either. SE could be the go to option for folks, who loved windows 7, because it includes StartIsBack. 
I will opt for Superlight without defender, but feel free to select anything.
IMPORTANT This is where you cannot mess up. If you choose wrong partition - you will destroy your backup files. If you used no USB method - be doubly careful, because you can format your installation drive...
You can manage partitions here if you want, but I'll just continue installation.


After you've done with installation - you will see this window. We will select last update option and computer will restart. Now the most important part of optimization - Ghost Toolbox. Don't be scared of CLI interface, it wont byte you. Let's disable useless features, which no one uses. Action centre and Notification. It's window, which stores every notification, which is useless and affects computer perfomance. Cortana? Who the heck need cortana?. If you use printers, you can turn on this function... Turn off. If you use Tablet input you can literally touch grass with it! But if not - you can turn off this function.
Go back to menu. You can activate your windows in fourth tweak. Then you can turn off updates until 2077 year.
You will defenetly need MIcrosoft store in the future .
Then you'll need to install Visual C++ and DirectX. Turn off bingbar. 
After that you'll love to install google chrome, since here's only internet explorer. There's also 7-zip app, which is useful, so install it too.
39 stands for GAMING tweaks. Go to this option and then select  Old tweaked windows 10. Disable startup delay, Next option  can increase chances of hackers accessing your computer if you use it as server. If not - you can turn it off, because sometimes it boost your fps a lot. Then enable ultimate perfomance plan if you use PC. Congratulations! You're done with most boring part of configuring!


It's also important part, as people say it can double your fps.
Download nvclearstall. You can find link in the comments. Now choose first option and press "Recommend" button. After that, if you can also check other options, such as shadowplay. You can simply repeat after me.
After that you'll need to go to nvidia control panel and configure it as I have."""
